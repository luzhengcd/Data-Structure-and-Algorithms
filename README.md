# Data Structure and Algorithms

In this repo, I will follow the picture below and cover the commonly-seen data structure and algorithms with leetcode examples.

A little bit about my data structure and algorithms learning path.  

I took data structure course in my undergrad, but forget about almost everything before I took the algorithms course in my master. In march, I received an interview request from Google, and I was lucky enough to make it to final round, but still got rejected. The moment when I received the email was when I really started to pick up everything I learned and use data structure and algorithms to solve leetcode problem. 

During the preperation process, my leetcode record hit 200 + from 30 +, and finally get a sense of how the data structure and algorithms thing work. To solidify my data structure and algorithm knowledge I decided to initialize this repo. If you are new to data structure and algorithms, here are a fews things I would highly recommend you to do: 
> 
> * Take a look at those commonly-used data structure, like stack, link list, tree, etc, and get yourself comfortable with the most common operations (insert, delete, reverse, modify, access an element) on these data structure and their time complexity in big O notation.
> * Take at least one algorithm course, [this](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud401) is online version of the one I took at Georgia Tech. I really like the professor, because he explains thing well, and I believe the online version is as good as the on-campus one.
> * Practice, practice, and practice...
